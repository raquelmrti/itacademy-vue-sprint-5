# Front End Development with Vue.js - IT Academy

## **Sprint 5 - Jokes**

This sprint focuses on TypeScript and, more importantly, APIs. The project brief is the following:

> A coaching company is bringing an experiment to companies in Barcelona, where they are measuring the impact of humor and fun on productivity.
>
> They have asked us for a web application that shows jokes to employees before starting the working day.
>
> You will be in charge of carrying out the basis of the project to perform a demo in two weeks with the client and start testing with real users.

We will be using the [icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).

In addition to the dad jokes, also consume an API about Chuck Norris jokes and make it so that the jokes randomly switch between the dad ones and Chuck Norris ones.
